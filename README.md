Electroshop is an HTML template of an online shop for smart watches.
It is build using HTML5 and CSS3 with a grid system based on the grid css layout.

## Technical Aspects

- CSS grid was used for the main layout, using [griddle](https://github.com/aldemeery/griddle), which is
  a very lightweight grid system based on the `display: grid` css property.
- Flexbox was used at specific parts of the page, like the nav bar, the header body, and the button groups.
- No javascript was used.
- The design is fully responsive acorss different view port sizes.
